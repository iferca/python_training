    "# Django Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is a powerful Python Model View Controller (MVC) framework, although in the documentation it is referred as Model - Templae -View (MTV) framework, the two terms can be used and are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Django was developed in a fast-paced newsroom environment, it was designed to make common web development tasks fast and easy. It is very well documented, has a very active community, brings a rapid developent and deployment, there are thousands of packages, plugins and apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some very populas sites use Django as Instagram, Pinterest, NASA, National Geographic, Mozilla and The Guardian.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Django installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Django in your project or system, add the `Django` dependency or install it as usual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding `Django` to `requirements.txt` file will bring the latest version (desirable most of the time) and then: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install it manually using: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install Django\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django version can be verified as follow in code: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import django\n",
    "\n",
    "print(django.get_version())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or using the following command: \n",

    "```\n",
    "python -m django --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a project\n",
    "\n",
    "Django framework provides developers with some django-specific management functionalities like creating projects and applications, database migration and even provides a development server to run the project locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new django project named `mysite`, go to the desired directory and type the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "django-admin startproject mysite\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "this will create a `mysite` in your current direcory containing the following files and folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".\n",
    "└── mysite\n",
    "    ├── manage.py\n",

    "        └── wsgi.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The outer **mysite/** root directory is a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.\n",
    "* **manage.py**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways.\n",
    "* The inner **mysite/** directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).\n",
    "* **mysite/settings.py**: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings will tell you all about how settings work.\n",
    "* **mysite/urls.py**: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The development server\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s verify your Django project works. Change into the outer **mysite** directory, if you haven’t already, and run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python manage.py runserver\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve started the Django development server, a lightweight web server written purely in Python. It is included with Django so you can develop things rapidly, without having to deal with configuring a production server – such as Apache – until you’re ready for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the server will listen for connection on the local interface, interface and port can be customized passing additional parameters to `runserver`: \n",
    "\n",

    "Now that your environment – a “project” – is set up, you’re set to start doing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each application you write in Django consists of a Python package that follows a certain convention. Django comes with an utility that automatically generates the basic directory structure of an app, so you can focus on writing code rather than creating directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Projects vs. apps**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something – e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small greeter app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your apps can live anywhere on your Python path. For this example the let's create our app in the same directory as your manage.py file so that it can be imported as its own top-level module, rather than a submodule of mysite.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python manage.py startapp greeter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That will create a directory `greeter`, your folder project should look something like this:\n",

    "## Introducing Django Admin\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete content is tedious work that doesn’t require much creativity. For that reason, Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django was written in a newsroom environment, with a very clear separation between “content publishers” and the “public” site. Site managers use the system to add news stories, events, sports scores, etc., and that content is displayed on the public site. Django solves the problem of creating a unified interface for site administrators to edit content.\n",

    "The admin isn’t intended to be used by site visitors. It’s for site managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an admin user\n",
    "\n",
    "First we’ll need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:\n",

    "\n",
